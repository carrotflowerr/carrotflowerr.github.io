    <h3>Tools I cannot live without</h3>

		This isn't going to be a text editor, distro, multiplexer list. You know about tmux and neovim. I wanna put you on to some cool stuff.

		<ul>
			<li>HTTPrack: can download and mirror sites with faithful js and media rendering. All the <a href="https://carrotflowerr.github.io/sites" sites here></a> have been mirrored and automatically updated by me.</li>
	<li>Speaking of automation, next we have cron. Cron is a gnu util that can run commands over intervals of time. Using cron is a pain in the ass, but when you learn it it's worth it. There are many bloated electron "gui's" that are meant to simplify cron. But don't.</li>
