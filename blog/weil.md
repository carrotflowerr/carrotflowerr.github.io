**Brian Weil** (1954–1996) was a photographer, activist, and writer most well known for his work on the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic and founding the [[Needle and syringe programmes|Needle Exchange]] program in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Roberta |title=Brian Weil, 41, Photographer Who Founded Needle Exchange |work=The New York Times |date=8 February 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/08/nyregion/brian-weil-41-photographer-who-founded-needle-exchange.html |access-date=5 July 2024}}</ref> Art critic [[Roberta Smith]] wrote his ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary. The headline referred to him as the “Photographer Who Founded [[Needle and syringe programmes|Needle Exchange]].” 

## Personal life
Weil was born in Chicago in 1954 where he attended [[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College]]. He was a secular Jew and his father was a Holocaust survivor. Weil learned black-and-white photography from his brother, Kenneth. Shortly after, he started producing 3x3 inch portraits of patients in a home for the mentally disabled. This was his first project, and he finished it by the time he was 17. 

In 1976, Weil moved to New York and did work documenting artworks, commercial galleries, and assisting other photographers including his friend [[Larry Clark]].

## Career
Weil's first exhibition was in 1980 at the [[Artists Space]]. His photography covered many topics from Hasidic Jews to sex workers. Weil was most passionate about AIDS and its effect on his city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gregory |first1=Stamatina |title=Brian Weil, 1979–1995: Being in the World |url=https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/10-brian-weil-1979-1995-br-being-in-the-world |website=Institute of Contemporary Art}}</ref> Although his work is closely tied to his activism, the unrelated pieces received attention as well. Much of his photography was dark and grainy; he used close-up angles and harsh lighting extensively. Stamatina Gregory described his photography as: "Weil's AIDS-related photos as well as earlier, freakier projects that profile fringe groups, sex nuts (e.g., an aroused man and a fish tank!), dead people, and boxers. Weil's deep engagement with his subjects should emerge through his characteristic scrim of grainy film."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gregory |first1=Stamatina |title=Brian Weil |url=https://www.artforum.com/events/brian-weil-195008/ |website=artforum |date=January 2013 |access-date=5 July 2024}}</ref>

The University of Arizona Center for Creative Photography describes his range of topics as such:

- Gender identity
- Gender transition
- Hasidim
- Homicide investigation
- Protest movements -- United States
