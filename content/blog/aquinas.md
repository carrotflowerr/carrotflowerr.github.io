	I've recently been reading through Thomas Aquinas' *Summa Theologica.* The Summa Theologica is a compilation of arguments cocerned with the nature of God and religion. 
	
	
	This work and Aquinas himeself have been endlessly studied and praised. I am by no means an expert on his work. This should come off as thoughts on the work in isolation. 
	
	
The book is formatted in labled forms of arguemnts - premises, counterpoints, and conclusion. In this I see a kinship with Descartes. I appriciate this, but the arguments he makes are simply not up to par.
