### Some brief thoughts on BlueSky

BlueSky is now the most popular alternative to Twitter (X). After a few
months of use here are my thoughts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1) BlueSky has yet to find it\'s identity.

BlueSky currently starts and ends at being the \"not twitter.\" They\'re
developing new terms like skeet and reskeet (instead of tweet) which is
cute. If it keeps existing out of rebellion it will soon fade into
obscurity like threads.

#### 2) BlueSky is pleasant

The toxicity on BlueSky is non-existant compaired to twitter. You see
what you want (thanks to feeds) and not much else.

#### 3) BlueSky is boring

Not many people you would want to follow are there for you to follow.
Nothing funny happens. If you come from the old internet like me, it
feels very plain. It does, however, have porn.

#### 4) BlueSky is not decentralized

I\'ll refer you

detailed technical explination.
