	The popular philosophical landscape is quite limited. Nothing but the Matrix is *required reading* for a culturally literate person. The first step one will take into philosophy will almost certianly be existentialism. This is because it directly concerns the feeling we're all familiar with. Of the broad selection of existentialists, mosts first author wouldn't claim the label for himself. I am talking about Albert Camus. Although Camus warrents attention, I see no reason for him to be the first. 
	
	In the Myth of Sisyphus he begins the essay claiming that the question of suicide is the first and foremost question of philosophy. I disagree with this. But it does place his own analysis in the importance he thinks it deserves. 
	
	My problem is that Camus is as much philosophy as it is art. Infact, I consider the works of Doestevsky more philisophically dense.
