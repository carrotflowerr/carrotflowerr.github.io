	The popular philosophical landscape is quite limited. Nothing but the Matrix is *required reading* for a culturally literate person. The first step one will take into philosophy will almost certianly be existentialism. This is because it directly concerns the feeling we're all familiar with. Of the broad selection of existentialists, mosts first author wouldn't claim the label for himself. I am talking about Albert Camus. Although Camus warrents attention, I see no reason for him to be the first. 
	
	In the Myth of Sisyphus he begins the essay claiming that the question of suicide is the first and foremost question of philosophy. I disagree with this. But it does place his own analysis in the importance he thinks it deserves. 
	
	My problem is that Camus is as much philosophy as it is art. Infact, I consider the works of Doestevsky more philisophically dense. 


	Many people who start with Camus, finish with Camus. 
	
	Camus is not really cited. He doesn't interact with philosophy in the way one would expect. He isolates himself with his own metaphors and mannerisms, and I find it to be irritating. I see connections and he never touches on them.
	
For sisyphus, for exmaple. Why is sisyphus happy? (a question seldom answered by the pop philosophy reader.) Is it because he is the one man with a goal from the gods? is it because he comes closer to his objet a every day? No, not at all. Camus comes to the conclusion that sisyphus is happy because the situation is funny. This is devoid of life. 

"Most people ignore most philosophy, because most philosophy ignores most people."
Camus' resolution is to ignore philosophy. 

If you want to read Camus, read Dostoevsky or Kafka or something. These names are cited.
